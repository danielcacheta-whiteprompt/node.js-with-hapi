This project has been created to get familiar with some of the hapi.js features.

To run the code, it is necessary to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed and run `npm install` on the project folder to download all of the npm dependencies.

After installing the packages, run `npm start` to run the server. It will be listening to the port 3000.
